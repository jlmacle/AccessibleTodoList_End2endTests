[More information concerning the project can be found on javafullstackcode.wordpress.com](https://javafullstackcode.wordpress.com/, "Java Full Stack Code")

The code illustrates the use of [TestNG](https://testng.org/doc/index.html "TestNG website homepage"), [Selenium Webdriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/ "Selenium webdriver page") and [Tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/ "Tesseract on GitHub"), an opensource OCR recognition engine.

The code should be able to run "as is" on Windows.

I have an issue running the code on Linux (Tesseract).
The code hasn't been run yet on macOS.
