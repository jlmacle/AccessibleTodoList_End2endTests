[More information concerning the project can be found on javafullstackcode.wordpress.com](https://javafullstackcode.wordpress.com/, "Java Full Stack Code")

The end-to-end testing uses [TestNG](https://testng.org/doc/index.html "TestNG website homepage").

The code illustrates the use of [Selenium Webdriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/ "Selenium webdriver page"). 

The classes Actions and Robot are used in the context of testing a navigation using the keyboard only.

For the purpose of testing a display/hiding feature, [Tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/ "Tesseract on GitHub"), an opensource OCR recognition engine is being used.
